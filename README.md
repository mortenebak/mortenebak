### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­  I'm Morten from Denmark. I'm currently working as a Webdeveloper at [Indexed](https://www.indexed.dk/) where I'm the goto-guy for WordPress and Laravel at the Office. I do try to get to work on Laravel projects as much as I possibly can (both at Work and in my sparetime).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Nuxtjs/Vuejs.
